Note that the ability to install on the sd card requires API level 8. Setting the

the minSdkVersion to 7 and the build target to 8, we get backward compatibility - 
apparently the 2.2 build can be installed on a 2.1 device. See
http://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/install-location.html.

reject them. This conversion can be done via:

iconv -f ISO-8859-1 -t UTF-8 units.dat > units.new
