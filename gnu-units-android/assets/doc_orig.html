<h2 class="chapter">1 Overview of <code>units</code></h2>

<p>The <code>units</code> program converts quantities expressed in various scales
to their equivalents in other scales.  The <code>units</code> program can
handle multiplicative scale changes as well as nonlinear
conversions such as Fahrenheit to
<!-- man Celsius. -->
<!-- noman -->

<!-- end noman -->
Temperature conversions require a special
syntax. 
<!-- noman -->
See <a href="#Temperature-Conversion-Example">Temperature Conversion Example</a>. 
<!-- end noman -->
<!-- man See the examples below. -->

   </p><p>The units are defined in an external data file.  You can use the
extensive data file that comes with this program, or you can
provide your own data file to suit your needs.

   </p><p>You can use the program interactively
with prompts, or you can use it
from the command line.

<h2 class="chapter">2 Interacting with <code>units</code></h2>

<p><a name="index-interactive-use-1"></a>
To invoke units for interactive use, type <kbd>units</kbd> at your shell
prompt.  The program will print something like this:

</p><pre class="example">         2131 units, 53 prefixes, 24 nonlinear units
     
         You have:
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">At the <span class="samp">You have:</span> prompt, type the quantity and units that
you are converting <em>from</em>.  For example, if you want to convert ten
meters to feet, type <kbd>10 meters</kbd>.  Next, <code>units</code> will print
<span class="samp">You want:</span>.  You should type the type of units you want to convert
<em>to</em>.  To convert to feet, you would type <kbd>feet</kbd>.  Note that if
the readline library was compiled in then the tab key can be used to
complete unit names.  See <a href="#Readline-support">Readline support</a>, for more information
about readline.

   </p><p>The answer will be displayed in two ways.  The first line of output,
which is marked with a <span class="samp">*</span> to indicate multiplication,
gives the result of the conversion you have asked for.  The second line
of output, which is marked with a <span class="samp">/</span> to indicate division, gives
the inverse of the conversion factor.  If you convert 10 meters to feet,
<code>units</code> will print

</p><pre class="example">             * 32.808399
             / 0.03048
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which tells you that 10 meters equals about 32.8 feet. 
The second number gives the conversion in the opposite direction. 
In this case, it tells you that 1 foot is equal to about
0.03 dekameters since the dekameter is 10 meters. 
It also tells you that 1/32.8 is about .03.

   </p><p>The <code>units</code> program prints the inverse because sometimes it is a
more convenient number.  In the example above, for example, the inverse
value is an exact conversion: a foot is exactly .03048 dekameters. 
But the number given the other direction is inexact.

   </p><p>If you try to convert grains to pounds, you will see the following:

</p><pre class="example">         You have: grains
         You want: pounds
                 * 0.00014285714
                 / 7000
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">From the second line of the output you can immediately see that a grain
is equal to a seven thousandth of a pound.  This is not so obvious from
the first line of the output. 
If you find  the output format  confusing, try using the
<span class="samp">--verbose</span> option:
<a name="index-verbose-output-2"></a>
</p><pre class="example">         You have: grain
         You want: aeginamina
                 grain = 0.00010416667 aeginamina
                 grain = (1 / 9600) aeginamina
</pre>
   <p>If you request a conversion between units which measure reciprocal
dimensions, then <code>units</code> will display the conversion results with an extra
note indicating that reciprocal conversion has been done:
<a name="index-reciprocal-conversion-3"></a>
</p><pre class="example">         You have: 6 ohms
         You want: siemens
                 reciprocal conversion
                 * 0.16666667
                 / 6
</pre>
   <p>Reciprocal conversion can be suppressed by using the <span class="samp">--strict</span> option. 
As usual, use
the <span class="samp">--verbose</span> option to get more comprehensible output:
<a name="index-verbose-output-4"></a><a name="index-strict-conversion-5"></a>
</p><pre class="example">         You have: tex
         You want: typp
                 reciprocal conversion
                 1 / tex = 496.05465 typp
                 1 / tex = (1 / 0.0020159069) typp
     
         You have: 20 mph
         You want: sec/mile
                 reciprocal conversion
                 1 / 20 mph = 180 sec/mile
                 1 / 20 mph = (1 / 0.0055555556) sec/mile
</pre>
   <p>If you enter incompatible unit types, the <code>units</code> program will
print a message indicating that the units are not conformable and
it will display the reduced form for each unit:
<a name="index-incompatible-units-6"></a><a name="index-non_002dconformable-units-7"></a>
</p><pre class="example">         You have: ergs/hour
         You want: fathoms kg^2 / day
         conformability error
                 2.7777778e-11 kg m^2 / sec^3
                 2.1166667e-05 kg^2 m / sec
</pre>
   <p>If you only want to find the reduced form or definition of a unit,
simply press return at the <span class="samp">You want:</span> prompt.  Here is an example:

</p><pre class="example">         You have: jansky
         You want:
                 Definition: fluxunit = 1e-26 W/m^2 Hz = 1e-26 kg / s^2
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The output from <code>units</code> indicates that the jansky is defined to be
equal to a fluxunit which in turn is defined to be a certain combination
of watts, meters, and hertz.  The fully reduced (and in this case
somewhat more cryptic) form appears on the far right.

   </p><p>Some named units are treated as dimensionless in some situations. 
These include the radian and steradian.  These units will be treated
as equal to 1 in units conversions.  Power is equal to torque times
angular velocity.  This conversion can only be performed if the radian
is dimensionless.

</p><pre class="example">         You have: (14 ft lbf) (12 radians/sec)
         You want: watts
                 * 227.77742
                 / 0.0043902509
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Note that named dimensionaless units are not treated as dimensionless
in other contexts.  They cannot be used as exponents
so for example, <span class="samp">meter^radian</span> is not allowed. 
<a name="index-dimensionless-units-8"></a>
If you want a list of options you can type <kbd>?</kbd> at the
<span class="samp">You want:</span> prompt.  The program will display a list of named
units which are conformable with the unit that you entered at
the <span class="samp">You have:</span> prompt above.  Note that conformable unit
combinations will not appear on this list.

   </p><p>Typing <kbd>help</kbd> at either prompt displays a short help message. 
You can also type <kbd>help</kbd> followed by a unit name.  This will
invoke a pager on the units data base at the point where that unit
is defined.  You can read the definition and comments that may
give more details or historical information about the unit.

<h2 class="chapter">3 Using <code>units</code> non-interactively</h2>

<p><a name="index-command-line-unit-conversion-9"></a><a name="index-non_002dinteractive-unit-conversion-10"></a>
The <code>units</code> program can perform units conversions non-interactively
from the command line.  To do this, type the command, type the
original units expression, and type the new units you want. 
You will probably need to protect the units expressions from
interpretation by the shell using single quote characters.

   </p><p>If you type

</p><pre class="example">         units '2 liters' 'quarts'
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">then <code>units</code> will print

</p><pre class="example">             * 2.1133764
             / 0.47317647
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and then exit. 
The output tells you that 2 liters is about 2.1 quarts, or alternatively that
a quart is about 0.47 times 2 liters.

   </p><p>If the conversion is successful, then <code>units</code> will return success (0)
to the calling environment.  If <code>units</code> is given non-conformable
units to convert, it will print a message giving the reduced form of
each unit and it will return failure (nonzero) to the calling environment.

   </p><p>When <code>units</code> is invoked with only one argument, it will print out
the definition of the specified unit.  It will return failure if the
unit is not defined and success if the unit is defined.

<h2 class="chapter">4 Unit expressions</h2>

<p><a name="index-unit-expressions-11"></a>
In order to enter more complicated units or fractions,
you will need to use operations such as powers, products and division. 
Powers of units can be specified using the <span class="samp">^</span> character as shown in
the following example, or by simple concatenation: <span class="samp">cm3</span> is equivalent to
<span class="samp">cm^3</span>. 
If the exponent is more than one digit, the <span class="samp">^</span> is required.  An
exponent like <span class="samp">2^3^2</span> is evaluated right to left.  The <span class="samp">^</span>
operator has the second highest precedence. 
<a name="index-powers-12"></a><a name="index-products-13"></a>
</p><pre class="example">         You have: cm^3
         You want: gallons
                 * 0.00026417205
                 / 3785.4118
     
         You have: arabicfoot * arabictradepound * force
         You want: ft lbf
                 * 0.7296
                 / 1.370614
</pre>
   <p>Multiplication of units can be specified by using spaces, or an asterisk
(<span class="samp">*</span>).  If <code>units</code> is invoked with the <span class="samp">--product</span>
option then the hyphen (<span class="samp">-</span>) also acts as a multiplication
operator.  Division of units is indicated
by the slash (<span class="samp">/</span>) or by <span class="samp">per</span>. 
<a name="index-multiplication-of-units-14"></a><a name="index-division-of-units-15"></a>
</p><pre class="example">         You have: furlongs per fortnight
         You want: m/s
                 * 0.00016630986
                 / 6012.8727
</pre>
   <p>Multiplication has a higher precedence than division and is evaluated
left to right, so
<span class="samp">m/s * s/day</span> is equivalent to <span class="samp">m / s s day</span> and has dimensions of
length per time cubed.  Similarly, <span class="samp">1/2 meter</span> refers to a unit of reciprocal length
equivalent to .5/meter, which is
probably not what you would intend if you entered that expression. 
You can indicate division of numbers
with the vertical dash (<span class="samp">|</span>).  This operator has the highest
precedence so the square root of two thirds could be written <span class="samp">2|3^1|2</span>. 
<a name="index-fractions-16"></a><a name="index-division-of-numbers-17"></a>
</p><pre class="example">         You have: 1|2 inch
         You want: cm
                 * 1.27
                 / 0.78740157
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Parentheses can be used for grouping as desired.

</p><pre class="example">         You have: (1/2) kg / (kg/meter)
         You want: league
                 * 0.00010356166
                 / 9656.0833
</pre>
   <p>Prefixes are defined separately from base units.  In order to get
centimeters, the units database defines <span class="samp">centi-</span> and <span class="samp">c-</span> as
prefixes.  Prefixes can appear alone with no unit following them. 
An exponent applies only to the immediately preceding unit and its
prefix so that <span class="samp">cm^3</span> or <span class="samp">centimeter^3</span> refer to cubic centimeters
but <span class="samp">centi*meter^3</span> refers to hundredths of cubic meters.  Only one
prefix is permitted per unit, so <span class="samp">micromicrofarad</span> will fail, but
<span class="samp">micro*microfarad</span> will work, as will <span class="samp">micro microfarad</span>..

   </p><p>For <code>units</code>, numbers are just another kind of unit.  They can
appear as many times as you like and in any order in a unit expression. 
For example, to find the volume of a box which is 2 ft by 3 ft by 12 ft
in steres, you could do the following:

</p><pre class="example">         You have: 2 ft 3 ft 12 ft
         You want: stere
                 * 2.038813
                 / 0.49048148
     
         You have: $ 5 / yard
         You want: cents / inch
                 * 13.888889
                 / 0.072
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">And the second example shows how the dollar sign in the units conversion
can precede the five.  Be careful:  <code>units</code> will interpret
<span class="samp">$5</span> with no space as equivalent to dollars^5.

   </p><p>Outside of the SI system, it is often desirable to add values of
different units together.  You may also wish to use <code>units</code> as a
calculator that keeps track of units.  Sums of conformable units are written with
the <span class="samp">+</span> character. 
<a name="index-sums-of-units-18"></a><a name="index-addition-of-units-19"></a>
</p><pre class="example">         You have: 2 hours + 23 minutes + 32 seconds
         You want: seconds
                 * 8612
                 / 0.00011611705
     
         You have: 12 ft + 3 in
         You want: cm
                 * 373.38
                 / 0.0026782366
     
         You have: 2 btu + 450 ft lbf
         You want: btu
                 * 2.5782804
                 / 0.38785542
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The expressions which are added together must reduce to identical
expressions in primitive units, or an error message will be displayed:

</p><pre class="example">         You have: 12 printerspoint + 4 heredium
                                               ^
         Illegal sum of non-conformable units
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Historically <span class="samp">-</span> has been used for products of units, which complicates
its iterpretation in <code>units</code>.  Because <code>units</code> provides
several other ways to obtain unit products, and because <span class="samp">-</span> is a
subtraction operator in general algebraic expressions, <code>units</code>
treats the binary <span class="samp">-</span> as a subtraction operator by default.  This
behavior can be altered using the <span class="samp">--product</span> option which
causes <code>units</code> to treat the binary <span class="samp">-</span> operator as a product
operator.  Note that when <span class="samp">-</span> is a multiplication operator it has
the same precedence as <span class="samp">*</span>, but when <span class="samp">-</span> is a subtraction operator
it has the lower precedence as the addition operator.

   </p><p>When <span class="samp">-</span> is used as a unary operator it negates its operand. 
Regardless of the <code>units</code> options, if
<span class="samp">-</span> appears after <span class="samp">(</span> or after
<span class="samp">+</span> then it will act as a negation operator.  So you can always compute 20
degrees minus 12 minutes by entering <span class="samp">20 degrees + -12 arcmin</span>. 
You must use this construction when you define new units because you
cannot know what options will be in force when your definition is
processed.

   </p><p>The <span class="samp">+</span> character sometimes appears in exponents like
<span class="samp">3.43e+8</span>.  This leads to an ambiguity in an expression like
<span class="samp">3e+2 yC</span>.  The unit <span class="samp">e</span> is a small unit of charge, so this
can be regarded as equivalent to <span class="samp">(3e+2) yC</span> or <span class="samp">(3 e)+(2 yC)</span>. 
This ambiguity is resolved by always interpreting <span class="samp">+</span> as part
of an exponent if possible.

<span class="samp">atan</span> and <span class="samp">asin</span>.  The <span class="samp">sin</span>, <span class="samp">cos</span>, and <span class="samp">tan</span>
functions require either a dimensionless argument or an argument with
dimensions of angle.

</p><pre class="example">         You have: sin(30 degrees)

   </p><p><a name="index-roots-21"></a><a name="index-square-roots-22"></a>If you wish to take roots of units, you may use the <span class="samp">sqrt</span> or
<span class="samp">cuberoot</span> functions.  These functions require that the argument
have the appropriate root.  Higher roots can  be obtained by using
fractional exponents:

<p><a name="index-temperature-conversions-23"></a><a name="Temperature-Conversion-Example"></a>
Nonlinear units are represented using functional notation.  They make
possible nonlinear unit conversions such temperature.  This is different
from the linear units that convert temperature differences.  Note the
difference below.  The absolute temperature conversions are handled by
units starting with <span class="samp">temp</span>, and you must use functional notation. 
The temperature differences are done using units starting with
<span class="samp">deg</span> and they do not require functional notation.

</p><pre class="example">         You have: tempF(45)
         You want: tempC
                 7.2222222
     
         You have: 45 degF
         You want: degC
                 * 25
                 / 0.04
</pre>
   <p>Think of <span class="samp">tempF(x)</span> not as a function but as a notation which
indicates that <span class="samp">x</span> should have units of <span class="samp">tempF</span> attached to
it.  See <a href="#Nonlinear-units">Nonlinear units</a>.  The first conversion shows that if it's 45
degrees Fahrehneit outside it's 7.2 degrees Celsius.  The second
conversions indicates that a change of 45 degrees Fahrenheit corresponds
to a change of 25 degrees Celsius.

   </p><p>Some other examples of nonlinears units are ring size and wire gauge. 
There are numerous different gauges and ring sizes.  See the units
database for more details.  Note that wire gauges
with multiple zeroes are signified using negative numbers where two
zeroes is -1.  Alternatively, you can use the synonyms <span class="samp">g00</span>,
<span class="samp">g000</span>, and so on that are defined in the units database.

</p><pre class="example">         You have: wiregauge(11)
         You want: inches
                 * 0.090742002
                 / 11.020255
     
         You have: brwiregauge(g00)
         You want: inches
                 * 0.348
                 / 2.8735632

<h2 class="chapter">5 Invoking <code>units</code></h2>

<p><a name="index-invoking-units-24"></a><a name="index-command-line-options-25"></a>
You invoke <code>units</code> like this:

</p><pre class="example">         units [<var>options</var>] [<var>from-unit</var> [<var>to-unit</var>]]
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If the <var>from-unit</var> and <var>to-unit</var> are omitted, then the program
will use interactive prompts to determine which conversions to perform. 
See <a href="#Interactive-use">Interactive use</a>. 
If both <var>from-unit</var> and <var>to-unit</var> are given, <code>units</code> will
print the result of that single conversion and then exit. 
If only <var>from-unit</var> appears on the command line, <code>units</code> will
display the definition of that unit and exit. 
Units specified on the command line will need
to be quoted to protect them from shell interpretation and to group
them into two arguments.  See <a href="#Command-line-use">Command line use</a>.

   </p><p>The following options allow you to read in an alternative units file,
check your units file, or change the output format:

     </p><dl>

to primitive units.  Print a list of all units that
cannot be reduced.  Also display some other diagnostics about
suspicious definitions in the units data file.  Note that only
definitions active in the current locale are checked.

cannot be reduced.  But to help find unit  definitions that cause
endless loops,
it lists the units as they are checked. 
If <code>units</code> hangs, then the last unit to be printed has a bad
definition.  Note that only
definitions active in the current locale are checked.

If <code>filename</code> is the empty string (<span class="samp">-f ''</span>)
then the default units file will
be loaded.  This enables you to load the default file plus a personal
units file.  Up to 25 units files may be specified on the command line. 
This option overrides the <code>UNITSFILE</code> environment variable.

The conversion information is read from a units data file which
is called <span class="file">units.dat</span> and is probably located in
the <span class="file">/usr/local/share</span> directory. 
If you invoke <code>units</code> with the <span class="samp">-V</span> option, it will print
the location of this file. 
The default
file includes definitions for all familiar units, abbreviations and
metric prefixes.  It also includes many obscure or archaic units.

   </p><p>Many constants of nature are defined, including these:
<!-- noman -->
</p><pre class="example">     pi          <span class="roman">ratio of circumference to diameter</span>
     c           <span class="roman">speed of light</span>

The database includes atomic masses for all of the elements and numerous
other constants.  Also included are the densities of various ingredients
used in baking so that <span class="samp">2 cups flour_sifted</span> can be converted
to <span class="samp">grams</span>.  This is not an exhaustive list.  Consult the units
data file to see the complete list, or to see the definitions that are
used.

   </p><p>The unit <span class="samp">pound</span> is a unit of mass.  To get force, multiply by the
force conversion unit <span class="samp">force</span> or use the shorthand <span class="samp">lbf</span>. 
(Note that <span class="samp">g</span> is already taken as the standard abbreviation for
the gram.)  The unit <span class="samp">ounce</span> is also a unit of mass.  The fluid
ounce is <span class="samp">fluidounce</span> or <span class="samp">floz</span>.  British capacity units that
differ from their US counterparts, such as the British Imperial gallon,
are prefixed with <span class="samp">br</span>.  Currency is prefixed with its country
name: <span class="samp">belgiumfranc</span>, <span class="samp">britainpound</span>.

   </p><p>The US Survey foot,
yard, and mile can be obtained by using the <span class="samp">US</span> prefix. 
These units differ slightly from the international length units. 
They were in general use until 1959, and are still used
for geographic surveys. 
The acre is officially defined in terms of the US Survey foot. 
If you want an acre
defined according to the international foot, use <span class="samp">intacre</span>.  The
difference between these units is
about 4 parts per million. 
The British also used a slightly different length measure before 1959. 
These can be obtained with the prefix <span class="samp">UK</span>.

   </p><p>When searching for
a unit, if the specified string does not appear exactly as a unit
name, then the <code>units</code> program will try to remove a
trailing <span class="samp">s</span> or a trailing <span class="samp">es</span>.  If that fails, <code>units</code>
will check for a prefix. 
All of the standard metric prefixes are defined.

   </p><p>To find out what units and prefixes are available, read the standard
units data file.

<h2 class="chapter">7 Defining new units</h2>

<p><a name="index-defining-units-55"></a><a name="index-units_002c-redefinition-of-56"></a><a name="index-changing-units-definitions-57"></a>
All of the units and prefixes that <code>units</code> can convert are defined
in the units data file.  If you want to add your own units, you can
supply your own file.

   </p><p>A unit is specified on a single line by giving its name and an
equivalence.  Comments start with a <span class="samp">#</span> character, which can appear
anywhere in a line.  The backslash character (<span class="samp">\</span>)
acts as a continuation
character if it appears as the last character on a line, making it
possible to spread definitions out over several lines if desired. 
A file can be included by giving the command <span class="samp">!include</span> followed by
the file's name.  The file will be sought in the same directory as the
parent file unless a full path is given. 
<a name="index-include-files-58"></a>
Unit names must not contain any of the operator characters <span class="samp">+</span>,
<span class="samp">-</span>, <span class="samp">*</span>, <span class="samp">/</span>, <span class="samp">|</span>, <span class="samp">^</span> or the parentheses. 
They cannot begin with a digit or a decimal point (<span class="samp">.</span>), nor can
they end with a digit (except for zero). 
Be careful to define
new units in terms of old ones so that a reduction leads to the
primitive units, which are marked with <span class="samp">!</span> characters. 
Dimensionless units are indicated by using the string
<span class="samp">!dimensionless</span> for the unit definition. 
<a name="index-dimensionless-units-59"></a>
When adding new units, be sure to use the <span class="samp">-c</span> option to check that
the new units reduce properly. 
If you create a loop in the units definitions, then <code>units</code> will
hang when invoked with the <span class="samp">-c</span> options.  You will need to
use the <span class="samp">--check-verbose</span> option which prints out each unit as it
checks them.  The program will still hang, but the last unit printed
will be the unit which caused the infinite loop.

   </p><p>If you define any units which contain
<span class="samp">+</span> characters, carefully check them because the <span class="samp">-c</span> option
will not catch non-conformable sums.  Be careful with the <span class="samp">-</span>
operator as well.  When used as a binary operator, the <span class="samp">-</span>
character can perform addition or multiplication
depending on the options used to invoke <code>units</code>. 
To ensure consistent behavior use <span class="samp">-</span> only as a unary negation
operator when writing units definitions.  To multiply two units leave a
space or use the <span class="samp">*</span> operator.  To compute the difference
of <span class="samp">foo</span> and <span class="samp">bar</span> write <span class="samp">foo+(-bar)</span> or even <span class="samp">foo+-bar</span>.

   </p><p>Here is an example of a short units file that defines some basic
units:
<!-- noman -->

</p><pre class="example">     m       !               # The meter is a primitive unit
     sec     !               # The second is a primitive unit
     rad     !dimensionless  # A dimensionless primitive unit
     micro-  1e-6            # Define a prefix
     minute  60 sec          # A minute is 60 seconds
     hour    60 min          # An hour is 60 minutes
     inch    0.0254 m        # Inch defined in terms of meters
     ft      12 inches       # The foot defined in terms of inches
     mile    5280 ft         # And the mile
</pre>
   <!-- end noman -->
<!-- man .in +2m -->
<!-- man .ta 9m +10m -->
<!-- man .nf -->
<!-- man -->
<!-- man m	!	# The meter is a primitive unit -->
<!-- man sec	!	# The second is a primitive unit -->
<!-- man rad	!dimensionless	# The second is a primitive unit -->
<!-- man micro-	1e-6	# Define a prefix -->
<!-- man minute	60 sec	# A minute is 60 seconds -->
<!-- man hour	60 min	# An hour is 60 minutes -->
<!-- man inch	0.0254 m	# Inch defined in terms of meters -->
<!-- man ft	12 inches	# The foot defined in terms of inches -->
<!-- man mile	5280 ft	# And the mile -->
<!-- man -->
<!-- man .fi -->
<!-- man .in -2m -->
<p class="noindent">A unit which ends with a <span class="samp">-</span> character is a prefix.  If a prefix
definition contains any <span class="samp">/</span> characters, be sure they are protected
by parentheses.  If you define <span class="samp">half- 1/2</span> then <span class="samp">halfmeter</span>
would be equivalent to <span class="samp">1 / 2 meter</span>.

<p><a name="index-defining-nonlinear-units-60"></a><a name="index-nonlinear-units_002c-redefinition-of-61"></a><a name="index-changing-nonlinear-unit-definitions-62"></a><a name="index-nonlinear-unit-conversions-63"></a>Some units conversions of interest are nonlinear; for
example, temperature conversions between the Fahrenheit and Celsius
scales cannot be done by simply multiplying by conversions factors.

   </p><p>When you give a linear unit definition such as <span class="samp">inch 2.54 cm</span> you
are providing information that <code>units</code> uses to convert values in
inches into primitive units of meters.  For nonlinear units, you give
a functional definition that provides the same information.

   </p><p>Nonlinear units are represented using a functional notation. 
It is best to regard this notation not as a function call but
as a way of adding units to a number, much the same way that
writing a linear unit name after a number adds units to that number. 
Internally, nonlinear units are defined by a pair of functions
which convert to and from linear units in the data file, so that
an eventual conversion to primitive units is possible.

   </p><p>Here is an example nonlinear unit definition:

</p><pre class="example">     tempF(x) [1;K] (x+(-32)) degF + stdtemp ; (tempF+(-stdtemp))/degF + 32
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">A nonlinear unit definition comprises a unit name, a dummy parameter
name, two functions, and two corresponding units.  The functions tell
<code>units</code> how to convert to and from the new unit.  In order to
produce valid results, the arguments of these functions need to have
the correct dimensions.  To facilitate error checking, you may specify
the dimensions.

   </p><p>The definition begins with the unit name followed immediately (with no
spaces) by a <span class="samp">(</span> character.  In parentheses is the name of the
parameter.  Next is an optional specification of the units required by
the functions in this definition.  In the example above, the
<span class="samp">tempF</span> function requires an input argument conformable with
<span class="samp">1</span>.  For normal nonlinear units definitions the forward
function will always take a dimensionless argument. 
The inverse function requires an input argument conformable
with <span class="samp">K</span>.  In general the inverse function will need units
that match the quantity measured by your nonlinear unit. 
The sole purpose of the expression in brackets to enable
<code>units</code> to perform error checking on function arguments.

   </p><p>Next the function definitions appear.  In the example above, the
<span class="samp">tempF</span> function is defined by

</p><pre class="example">         tempF(x) = (x+(-32)) degF + stdtemp
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This gives a rule for converting <span class="samp">x</span> in the units <span class="samp">tempF</span>
to linear units of absolute temperature, which makes it possible to
convert from tempF to other units.

   </p><p>In order to make conversions to Fahrenheit possible, you must give
a rule for the inverse conversions. The inverse will be <span class="samp">x(tempF)</span> and
its definition appears after a <span class="samp">;</span> character. 
In our example, the inverse is

</p><pre class="example">         x(tempF) = (tempF+(-stdtemp))/degF + 32
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This inverse definition takes an absolute temperature as its argument
and converts it to the Fahrenheit temperature.  The inverse can be
omitted by leaving out the <span class="samp">;</span> character, but then conversions to
the unit will be impossible.  If the inverse is omitted then the
<span class="samp">--check</span> option will display a warning.  It is up to you to
calculate and enter the correct inverse function to obtain proper
conversions.  The <span class="samp">--check</span> option tests the inverse at one point
and print an error if it is not valid there, but this is not a guarantee
that your inverse is correct.

   </p><p>If you wish to make synonyms for nonlinear units, you still need to define
both the forward and inverse functions.  Inverse functions can be
obtained using the <span class="samp">~</span> operator.  So to create a synonym
for <span class="samp">tempF</span> you could write

</p><pre class="example">         fahrenheit(x) [1;K] tempF(x); ~tempF(fahrenheit)
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-units-functions-64"></a><a name="index-functions-of-units-65"></a>You may occasionally wish to define a function that operates on units. 
This can be done
using a nonlinear unit definition.  For example, the definition below
provides conversion between radius and the area of a circle.  Note
that this definition requires a length as input and produces an
area as output, as indicated by the specification in brackets.

</p><pre class="example">         circlearea(r) [m;m^2] pi r^2 ; sqrt(circlearea/pi)
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-linear-interpolation-66"></a><a name="index-units_002c-piecewise-linear-67"></a><a name="index-piecewise-linear-units-68"></a>Sometimes you may be interested in a piecewise linear unit such as
many wire gauges.  Piecewise linear units can be defined by specifying
conversions to linear units on a list of points. 
Conversion at other points will be done by linear interpolation. 
A partial definition of zinc gauge is

</p><pre class="example">         zincgauge[in] 1 0.002, 10 0.02, 15 0.04, 19 0.06, 23 0.1
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In this example, <span class="samp">zincgauge</span> is the name of the piecewise linear
unit.  The definition of such a unit is indicated by the
embedded <span class="samp">[</span> character.  After the bracket, you should indicate the
units to be attached to the numbers in the table. 
No spaces can appear before the
<span class="samp">]</span> character, so a definition like <span class="samp">foo[kg meters]</span> is
illegal; instead write <span class="samp">foo[kg*meters]</span>.  The definition of the
unit consists of a list of pairs optionally separated by commas. 
This list defines a function for converting from the piecewise linear
unit to linear units.  The
first item in each pair is the function argument; the second item is the
value of the function at that argument (in the units specified in brackets). 
In this example,
we define <span class="samp">zincgauge</span> at five points.  For example, we set
<span class="samp">zincgauge(1)</span> equal to <span class="samp">0.002 in</span>.  Definitions like this
may be  more readable  if written using  continuation characters as
<!-- noman -->

</p><pre class="example">         zincgauge[in] \
              1 0.002  \
             10 0.02   \
             15 0.04   \
             19 0.06   \
             23 0.1
</pre>
   <!-- end noman -->
<!-- man .in +5m -->
<!-- man .ta 3m +3m -->
<!-- man .nf -->
<!-- man -->
<!-- man zincgauge[in]	 \\ -->
<!-- man 	1	0.002 \\ -->
<!-- man 	10	0.02 \\ -->
<!-- man 	15	0.04 \\ -->
<!-- man 	19	0.06 \\ -->
<!-- man 	23	0.1 -->
<!-- man .fi -->
<!-- man .in -2m -->
<p>With the preceeding definition, the following conversion can be
performed:

</p><pre class="example">         You have: zincgauge(10)
         You want: in
             * 0.02
             / 50
         You have: .01 inch
         You want: zincgauge
             5
</pre>
   <p>If you define a piecewise linear unit that is not strictly
monotonic, then the inverse will not be well defined.  If the inverse is
requested for such a unit, <code>units</code> will return the smallest
inverse.  The <span class="samp">--check</span> option will print a warning if a
non-monotonic piecewise linear unit is encountered.

<h2 class="chapter">9 Localization</h2>

<p><a name="index-localization-69"></a>
Some units have different values in different locations.  The
localization feature accomodates this by allowing the units database to
specify region dependent definitions.   A locale region in the units
database begins with <span class="samp">!locale</span> followed by the name of the locale. 
The leading <span class="samp">!</span> must appear in the first column of the units
database.  The locale region is terminated by <span class="samp">!endlocale</span>.  The
following example shows how to define a couple units in a locale.

</p><pre class="example">     !locale en_GB
     ton                     brton
     gallon                  brgallon
     !endlocale
</pre>
   <p>The current locale is specified
by the <code>LOCALE</code> environment variable.  Note that the <span class="samp">-c</span>
option only checks the definitions which are active for the current locale.

<h2 class="chapter">10 Environment variables</h2>

<p><a name="index-environment-variables-70"></a>
The <code>units</code> programs uses the following environment variables.

     </p><dl>
<dt><span class="samp">LOCALE</span></dt><dd><a name="index-LOCALE-environment-variable-71"></a>Specifies the locale.  The default is <span class="samp">en_US</span>.  Sections of the
units database are specific to certain locales.

     <br></dd><dt><span class="samp">PAGER</span></dt><dd><a name="index-PAGER-environment-variable-72"></a>Specifies the pager to use for help and for displaying the conformable
units.  The help function browses the units database and calls
the pager using the <code>+nn</code> syntax for specifying a line number.  The
default pager is <code>more</code>, but <code>less</code>, <code>emacs</code>, or
<code>vi</code> are possible alternatives.

     <br></dd><dt><span class="samp">UNITSFILE</span></dt><dd><a name="index-UNITSFILE-environment-variable-73"></a>Specifies the units database file to use (instead of the default). This
will be overridden by the <span class="samp">-f</span> option.  Note that you can only
specify a single units database using this environment variable.

<h2 class="chapter">11 Readline support</h2>

<p><a name="index-readline_002c-use-with-_0040code_007bunits_007d-74"></a>
If the <code>readline</code> package has been compiled in, then when
<code>units</code> is used interactively, numerous command line editing
features are available.  To check if your version of <code>units</code>
includes the readline, invoke the program with the <span class="samp">--version</span>
option.

   </p><p>For complete information about readline, consult the documentation for
the readline package.  Without any configuration, <code>units</code> will
allow editing in the style of emacs.  Of particular use with
<code>units</code> are the completion commands.

   </p><p>If you type a few characters and then hit <span class="samp">ESC</span> followed by the
<kbd>?</kbd> key then <code>units</code> will display a list of all the units which
start with the characters typed.  For example, if you type <kbd>metr</kbd> and
then request completion, you will see something like this:
<a name="index-unit-name-completion-75"></a>
</p><pre class="example">     You have: metr
     metre             metriccup         metrichorsepower  metrictenth
     metretes          metricfifth       metricounce       metricton
     metriccarat       metricgrain       metricquart       metricyarncount
     You have: metr
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If there is a unique way to complete a unitname, you can hit the tab key
and <code>units</code> will provide the rest of the unit name.  If <code>units</code>
beeps, it means that there is no unique completion.  Pressing the tab
key a second time will print the list of all completions.

Celsius is linear, you insist.  Not so.  A transformation T is linear if
T(x+y)=T(x)+T(y) and this fails for T(x)=ax+b.  This transformation is
affine, but not linear. </p>
