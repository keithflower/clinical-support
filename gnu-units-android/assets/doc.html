<h2 class="chapter">1 Overview of <code>units</code></h2>

<p>The <code>units</code> program converts quantities expressed in various scales
to their equivalents in other scales.  The <code>units</code> program can
handle multiplicative scale changes as well as nonlinear
conversions such as Fahrenheit to
<!-- man Celsius. -->
<!-- noman -->
Celsius.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
<!-- end noman -->
Temperature conversions require a special
syntax. 
<!-- noman -->
See <a href="#Temperature-Conversion-Example">Temperature Conversion Example</a>. 
<!-- end noman -->
<!-- man See the examples below. -->

   </p><p>The units are defined in an external data file.  You can use the
extensive data file that comes with this program, or you can
provide your own data file to suit your needs.

<h2 class="chapter">2 Android port of <code>units</code></h2>

<p>The Android version serves as a front-end to the standard GNU 
<code>units</code> program which has been recompiled with the Android Native
Development Kit. Thus, much of the original functionality of
<code>units</code> is maintained.<br><br>

GNU <code>units</code> was originally written by Adrian Mariano. <br><br>

The Android port works much like standard <code>units</code> invoked in interactive
mode (see below). Enter expressions for your known values in the <b>You have</b> entry box, and target conversion expressions in the
<b>You want</b> entry box. Press the <b>Convert</b> button. Conversion and other
information (formatted based on flags/options as described below)
appear in the editable <b>"Results"</b> box.<br><br>

Entry <b>history:</b> you can press your device's <b>Back</b> key in the <b>You have,</b>
<b>You want,</b> and <b>Results</b> boxes to cycle back through your entries. Press
<b>Back</b> twice in rapid succession to make the "back" function
behave as it ordinarily does. You can turn off this functionality via
Preferences if you don't like it. The application keeps track of your
previous 100 entries in each of the entry boxes, and maintains
this history even if you leave the application or turn off your phone.</br><br>

<b>Flags/Options:</b> with some exceptions, many of the original command-line options are
available in the Android version. These options can be changed using the
Flag/Options settings under the Preferences menu. For simplicity, the
Android version sets the <code>--terse</code> option initially by
default. You
can remove or change
this option if it does not suit you.<br><br>

<b>Autocompletion:</b> you can turn on autocompletion with the
<b>Autocomplete threshold</b> preferences item. Select the number of
characters entered that will trigger a drop-down list of recognized units of
measures and functions beginning with those characters. Autocompletion
is off by default.<br><br>

You can also enter <code>search xxx</code> (where <code>xxx</code> is some string of
   characters) in the <b>You have</b> box to
   search for units of measures and functions. For example, to search for
   units of measure that contain the string "amp", enter <code>search
   amp</code> and then press <b>Convert</b>. The <b>Results</b> box will contain:<pre><code>
       abamp           abampere
       abampere        10 A
       amp             ampere
       ampere          A
       amphora         8 congii
       amphorae        amphora
       intamp          intampere
       intampere       0.999835 A
       statamp         statampere
       statampere      10 A cm / s c
       thermalampere   W/K
</pre></code>

<b>Share:</b> this menu item allows you to select a sharing
application (e.g., email, text message), and copy a <code>units</code>
result to that application. The applications available for sharing
results depend on what you have installed on your device.<br><br>

You can specify <b>custom units files</b> using the <code>-f</code>
command-line option (set in <b>Preferences->Flags/Options</b>). You can also edit and/or replace the
<code>units.dat</code> file in its default 
directory (this location may vary based on your platform):

<pre><code>     /mnt/sdcard/Android/data/org.quexotic.gnuunits/files/units.dat</code></pre>

If you use the <code>-f</code> option, you have to specify the full
path to where you installed your custom units file. For example, you
could install your custom units file on your sdcard (a device's
optional memory card), and then use this file
by including the following <b>Preferences->Flags/Options</b>:

<pre><code>     -f /mnt/sdcard/myunits.dat -f ""</code></pre>

(Note the use of the <code>-f ""</code> flag, which loads the default
units file in addition to your custom units file - this is almost
always what you want to do.)<br><br>

If you edit  or use your own custom unit file, you should check it (<code>--check</code>)
using a non-Android version of <code>units</code> before use with the
Android port. <br><br>

A couple of custom data files are included with the
distribution as examples. Using

<pre><code>     -f /mnt/sdcard/gnuunits_med.dat -f ""</code></pre>

you can perform some limited medically-oriented conversions, such
as converting between traditional (U.S.) and SI units of measure for various lab values::

<pre><code>
           You have:  to_molarity(80 mg/dL glucose)
           You want:  mmol/L
           Results:   4.44 
</pre></code>

If you use

<pre><code>     -f /mnt/sdcard/gnuunits_fun.dat -f ""</code></pre>

you get access to some bonus definitions and conversions, for example,
"2000 mockingbird = 2 kilomockingbird," and others:

<pre><code>
            You have:  1 paradigm
            You want:
            Results:   Definition: 4 nickels

            You have:  1 unit_of_suspense_in_mystery_novel
            You want: 
	    Results:   Definition: 1 whod_unit
 
            You have:  1 gigolo
            You want:  picolos
            Results:   1e+21 picolos

            You have:  2 megacycles
            You want:  bicycles
            Results:   1e6 bicycles

            You have:  1 megaphone
            You want:  microphones
            Results:   1e12 microphones

            You have:  1 milliHelen_Of_Troy
            You want: 
	    Results:   Definition: 1 amount_of_face_that_can_launch_one_ship

</pre></code> 
(This file also allows use of the proposed <code>hella-</code> SI
prefix for values of 10^27. Using this prefix, you can determine that
"1 hellaHelen_Of_Troy" could launch 10^30 ships ("1000 hella ships").<br><br>
(Many of the conversions in <code>gnuunits_fun.dat</code> are adapted
from the "Q Files, a subsidiary of Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories"
(see
<code>http://windell.oskay.net/humor/qqqfiles/quarks1.html</code>),
which in turn notes
that the original information was taken from "The Bent of Tau Beta Pi,
Spring 1988").<br><br>

<h2 class="chapter">3 Interacting with <code>units</code></h2>


   <p class="noindent">At the <span class="samp">You have:</span> prompt, type the quantity and units that
you are converting <em>from</em>.  For example, if you want to convert ten
meters to feet, type <kbd>10 meters</kbd>.  Next, <code>units</code> will print
<span class="samp">You want:</span>.  You should type the type of units you want to convert
<em>to</em>.  To convert to feet, you would type <kbd>feet</kbd>. 

   </p><p>The answer will be displayed in two ways.  The first line of output,
which is marked with a <span class="samp">*</span> to indicate multiplication,
gives the result of the conversion you have asked for.  The second line
of output, which is marked with a <span class="samp">/</span> to indicate division, gives
the inverse of the conversion factor.  If you convert 10 meters to feet,
<code>units</code> will print

</p><pre class="example">             * 32.808399
             / 0.03048
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which tells you that 10 meters equals about 32.8 feet. 
The second number gives the conversion in the opposite direction. 
In this case, it tells you that 1 foot is equal to about
0.03 dekameters since the dekameter is 10 meters. 
It also tells you that 1/32.8 is about .03.

   </p><p>The <code>units</code> program prints the inverse because sometimes it is a
more convenient number.  In the example above, for example, the inverse
value is an exact conversion: a foot is exactly .03048 dekameters. 
But the number given the other direction is inexact.

   </p><p>If you try to convert grains to pounds, you will see the following:

</p><pre class="example">         You have: grains
         You want: pounds
                 * 0.00014285714
                 / 7000
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">From the second line of the output you can immediately see that a grain
is equal to a seven thousandth of a pound.  This is not so obvious from
the first line of the output. 
If you find  the output format  confusing, try using the
<span class="samp">--verbose</span> option:
<a name="index-verbose-output-2"></a>
</p><pre class="example">         You have: grain
         You want: aeginamina
                 grain = 0.00010416667 aeginamina
                 grain = (1 / 9600) aeginamina
</pre>
   <p>If you request a conversion between units which measure reciprocal
dimensions, then <code>units</code> will display the conversion results with an extra
note indicating that reciprocal conversion has been done:
<a name="index-reciprocal-conversion-3"></a>
</p><pre class="example">         You have: 6 ohms
         You want: siemens
                 reciprocal conversion
                 * 0.16666667
                 / 6
</pre>
   <p>Reciprocal conversion can be suppressed by using the <span class="samp">--strict</span> option. 
As usual, use
the <span class="samp">--verbose</span> option to get more comprehensible output:
<a name="index-verbose-output-4"></a><a name="index-strict-conversion-5"></a>
</p><pre class="example">         You have: tex
         You want: typp
                 reciprocal conversion
                 1 / tex = 496.05465 typp
                 1 / tex = (1 / 0.0020159069) typp
     
         You have: 20 mph
         You want: sec/mile
                 reciprocal conversion
                 1 / 20 mph = 180 sec/mile
                 1 / 20 mph = (1 / 0.0055555556) sec/mile
</pre>
   <p>If you enter incompatible unit types, the <code>units</code> program will
print a message indicating that the units are not conformable and
it will display the reduced form for each unit:
<a name="index-incompatible-units-6"></a><a name="index-non_002dconformable-units-7"></a>
</p><pre class="example">         You have: ergs/hour
         You want: fathoms kg^2 / day
         conformability error
                 2.7777778e-11 kg m^2 / sec^3
                 2.1166667e-05 kg^2 m / sec
</pre>
   <p>If you only want to find the reduced form or definition of a unit,
simply press return at the <span class="samp">You want:</span> prompt.  Here is an example:

</p><pre class="example">         You have: jansky
         You want:
                 Definition: fluxunit = 1e-26 W/m^2 Hz = 1e-26 kg / s^2
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The output from <code>units</code> indicates that the jansky is defined to be
equal to a fluxunit which in turn is defined to be a certain combination
of watts, meters, and hertz.  The fully reduced (and in this case
somewhat more cryptic) form appears on the far right.

   </p><p>Some named units are treated as dimensionless in some situations. 
These include the radian and steradian.  These units will be treated
as equal to 1 in units conversions.  Power is equal to torque times
angular velocity.  This conversion can only be performed if the radian
is dimensionless.

</p><pre class="example">         You have: (14 ft lbf) (12 radians/sec)
         You want: watts
                 * 227.77742
                 / 0.0043902509
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Note that named dimensionaless units are not treated as dimensionless
in other contexts.  They cannot be used as exponents
so for example, <span class="samp">meter^radian</span> is not allowed. 
<a name="index-dimensionless-units-8"></a>
If you want a list of options you can type <kbd>?</kbd> at the
<span class="samp">You want:</span> prompt.  The program will display a list of named
units which are conformable with the unit that you entered at
the <span class="samp">You have:</span> prompt above.  Note that conformable unit
combinations will not appear on this list.

<h2 class="chapter">4 Unit expressions</h2>

<p><a name="index-unit-expressions-11"></a>
In order to enter more complicated units or fractions,
you will need to use operations such as powers, products and division. 
Powers of units can be specified using the <span class="samp">^</span> character as shown in
the following example, or by simple concatenation: <span class="samp">cm3</span> is equivalent to
<span class="samp">cm^3</span>. 
If the exponent is more than one digit, the <span class="samp">^</span> is required.  An
exponent like <span class="samp">2^3^2</span> is evaluated right to left.  The <span class="samp">^</span>
operator has the second highest precedence. 
<a name="index-powers-12"></a><a name="index-products-13"></a>
</p><pre class="example">         You have: cm^3
         You want: gallons
                 * 0.00026417205
                 / 3785.4118
     
         You have: arabicfoot * arabictradepound * force
         You want: ft lbf
                 * 0.7296
                 / 1.370614
</pre>
   <p>Multiplication of units can be specified by using spaces, or an asterisk
(<span class="samp">*</span>).  If <code>units</code> is invoked with the <span class="samp">--product</span>
option then the hyphen (<span class="samp">-</span>) also acts as a multiplication
operator.  Division of units is indicated
by the slash (<span class="samp">/</span>) or by <span class="samp">per</span>. 
<a name="index-multiplication-of-units-14"></a><a name="index-division-of-units-15"></a>
</p><pre class="example">         You have: furlongs per fortnight
         You want: m/s
                 * 0.00016630986
                 / 6012.8727
</pre>
   <p>Multiplication has a higher precedence than division and is evaluated
left to right, so
<span class="samp">m/s * s/day</span> is equivalent to <span class="samp">m / s s day</span> and has dimensions of
length per time cubed.  Similarly, <span class="samp">1/2 meter</span> refers to a unit of reciprocal length
equivalent to .5/meter, which is
probably not what you would intend if you entered that expression. 
You can indicate division of numbers
with the vertical dash (<span class="samp">|</span>).  This operator has the highest
precedence so the square root of two thirds could be written <span class="samp">2|3^1|2</span>. 
<a name="index-fractions-16"></a><a name="index-division-of-numbers-17"></a>
</p><pre class="example">         You have: 1|2 inch
         You want: cm
                 * 1.27
                 / 0.78740157
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Parentheses can be used for grouping as desired.

</p><pre class="example">         You have: (1/2) kg / (kg/meter)
         You want: league
                 * 0.00010356166
                 / 9656.0833
</pre>
   <p>Prefixes are defined separately from base units.  In order to get
centimeters, the units database defines <span class="samp">centi-</span> and <span class="samp">c-</span> as
prefixes.  Prefixes can appear alone with no unit following them. 
An exponent applies only to the immediately preceding unit and its
prefix so that <span class="samp">cm^3</span> or <span class="samp">centimeter^3</span> refer to cubic centimeters
but <span class="samp">centi*meter^3</span> refers to hundredths of cubic meters.  Only one
prefix is permitted per unit, so <span class="samp">micromicrofarad</span> will fail, but
<span class="samp">micro*microfarad</span> will work, as will <span class="samp">micro microfarad</span>..

   </p><p>For <code>units</code>, numbers are just another kind of unit.  They can
appear as many times as you like and in any order in a unit expression. 
For example, to find the volume of a box which is 2 ft by 3 ft by 12 ft
in steres, you could do the following:

</p><pre class="example">         You have: 2 ft 3 ft 12 ft
         You want: stere
                 * 2.038813
                 / 0.49048148
     
         You have: $ 5 / yard
         You want: cents / inch
                 * 13.888889
                 / 0.072
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">And the second example shows how the dollar sign in the units conversion
can precede the five.  Be careful:  <code>units</code> will interpret
<span class="samp">$5</span> with no space as equivalent to dollars^5.

   </p><p>Outside of the SI system, it is often desirable to add values of
different units together.  You may also wish to use <code>units</code> as a
calculator that keeps track of units.  Sums of conformable units are written with
the <span class="samp">+</span> character. 
<a name="index-sums-of-units-18"></a><a name="index-addition-of-units-19"></a>
</p><pre class="example">         You have: 2 hours + 23 minutes + 32 seconds
         You want: seconds
                 * 8612
                 / 0.00011611705
     
         You have: 12 ft + 3 in
         You want: cm
                 * 373.38
                 / 0.0026782366
     
         You have: 2 btu + 450 ft lbf
         You want: btu
                 * 2.5782804
                 / 0.38785542
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The expressions which are added together must reduce to identical
expressions in primitive units, or an error message will be displayed:

</p><pre class="example">         You have: 12 printerspoint + 4 heredium
                                               ^
         Illegal sum of non-conformable units
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Historically <span class="samp">-</span> has been used for products of units, which complicates
its iterpretation in <code>units</code>.  Because <code>units</code> provides
several other ways to obtain unit products, and because <span class="samp">-</span> is a
subtraction operator in general algebraic expressions, <code>units</code>
treats the binary <span class="samp">-</span> as a subtraction operator by default.  This
behavior can be altered using the <span class="samp">--product</span> option which
causes <code>units</code> to treat the binary <span class="samp">-</span> operator as a product
operator.  Note that when <span class="samp">-</span> is a multiplication operator it has
the same precedence as <span class="samp">*</span>, but when <span class="samp">-</span> is a subtraction operator
it has the lower precedence as the addition operator.

   </p><p>When <span class="samp">-</span> is used as a unary operator it negates its operand. 
Regardless of the <code>units</code> options, if
<span class="samp">-</span> appears after <span class="samp">(</span> or after
<span class="samp">+</span> then it will act as a negation operator.  So you can always compute 20
degrees minus 12 minutes by entering <span class="samp">20 degrees + -12 arcmin</span>. 
You must use this construction when you define new units because you
cannot know what options will be in force when your definition is
processed.

   </p><p>The <span class="samp">+</span> character sometimes appears in exponents like
<span class="samp">3.43e+8</span>.  This leads to an ambiguity in an expression like
<span class="samp">3e+2 yC</span>.  The unit <span class="samp">e</span> is a small unit of charge, so this
can be regarded as equivalent to <span class="samp">(3e+2) yC</span> or <span class="samp">(3 e)+(2 yC)</span>. 
This ambiguity is resolved by always interpreting <span class="samp">+</span> as part
of an exponent if possible.

<span class="samp">atan</span> and <span class="samp">asin</span>.  The <span class="samp">sin</span>, <span class="samp">cos</span>, and <span class="samp">tan</span>
functions require either a dimensionless argument or an argument with
dimensions of angle.

   <p class="noindent">The other functions on the list require dimensionless arguments.  The
inverse trigonometric functions return arguments with dimensions of

   </p><p><a name="index-roots-21"></a><a name="index-square-roots-22"></a>If you wish to take roots of units, you may use the <span class="samp">sqrt</span> or
<span class="samp">cuberoot</span> functions.  These functions require that the argument
have the appropriate root.  Higher roots can  be obtained by using
fractional exponents:

</p><pre class="example">         You have: sqrt(acre)

   <h5 class="unnumberedsubsubsec">Temperature Conversion Example</h5>

<p><a name="index-temperature-conversions-23"></a><a name="Temperature-Conversion-Example"></a>
Nonlinear units are represented using functional notation.  They make
possible nonlinear unit conversions such temperature.  This is different
from the linear units that convert temperature differences.  Note the
difference below.  The absolute temperature conversions are handled by
units starting with <span class="samp">temp</span>, and you must use functional notation. 
The temperature differences are done using units starting with
<span class="samp">deg</span> and they do not require functional notation.

</p><pre class="example">         You have: tempF(45)
         You want: tempC
                 7.2222222
     
         You have: 45 degF
         You want: degC
                 * 25
                 / 0.04
</pre>
   <p>Think of <span class="samp">tempF(x)</span> not as a function but as a notation which
indicates that <span class="samp">x</span> should have units of <span class="samp">tempF</span> attached to
it.  See <a href="#Nonlinear-units">Nonlinear units</a>.  The first conversion shows that if it's 45
degrees Fahrehneit outside it's 7.2 degrees Celsius.  The second
conversions indicates that a change of 45 degrees Fahrenheit corresponds
to a change of 25 degrees Celsius.

   </p><p>Some other examples of nonlinears units are ring size and wire gauge. 
There are numerous different gauges and ring sizes.  See the units
database for more details.  Note that wire gauges
with multiple zeroes are signified using negative numbers where two
zeroes is -1.  Alternatively, you can use the synonyms <span class="samp">g00</span>,
<span class="samp">g000</span>, and so on that are defined in the units database.

</p><pre class="example">         You have: wiregauge(11)

<p><a name="index-invoking-units-24"></a><a name="index-command-line-options-25"></a>

   <p class="noindent">The program
uses interactive prompts to determine which conversions to perform. 
See <a href="#Interactive-use">Interactive use</a>. 
If both <var>from-unit</var> and <var>to-unit</var> are given, <code>units</code> will
print the result of that single conversion and then exit. 
If only <var>from-unit</var> appears on the command line, <code>units</code> will
display the definition of that unit and exit. 
Units specified on the command line will need
to be quoted to protect them from shell interpretation and to group
them into two arguments.  See <a href="#Command-line-use">Command line use</a>.

   </p><p>The following options allow you to read in an alternative

The conversion information is read from a units data file which
is called <span class="file">units.dat.</span> 
The default
file includes definitions for all familiar units, abbreviations and
metric prefixes.  It also includes many obscure or archaic units.

   </p><p>Many constants of nature are defined, including these:
<!-- noman -->
</p><pre class="example">     pi          <span class="roman">ratio of circumference to diameter</span>

The database includes atomic masses for all of the elements and numerous
other constants.  Also included are the densities of various ingredients
used in baking so that <span class="samp">2 cups flour_sifted</span> can be converted
to <span class="samp">grams</span>.  This is not an exhaustive list.  Consult the units
data file to see the complete list, or to see the definitions that are
used.

   </p><p>The unit <span class="samp">pound</span> is a unit of mass.  To get force, multiply by the
force conversion unit <span class="samp">force</span> or use the shorthand <span class="samp">lbf</span>. 
(Note that <span class="samp">g</span> is already taken as the standard abbreviation for
the gram.)  The unit <span class="samp">ounce</span> is also a unit of mass.  The fluid
ounce is <span class="samp">fluidounce</span> or <span class="samp">floz</span>.  British capacity units that
differ from their US counterparts, such as the British Imperial gallon,
are prefixed with <span class="samp">br</span>.  Currency is prefixed with its country
name: <span class="samp">belgiumfranc</span>, <span class="samp">britainpound</span>.

   </p><p>The US Survey foot,
yard, and mile can be obtained by using the <span class="samp">US</span> prefix. 
These units differ slightly from the international length units. 
They were in general use until 1959, and are still used
for geographic surveys. 
The acre is officially defined in terms of the US Survey foot. 
If you want an acre
defined according to the international foot, use <span class="samp">intacre</span>.  The
difference between these units is
about 4 parts per million. 
The British also used a slightly different length measure before 1959. 
These can be obtained with the prefix <span class="samp">UK</span>.

   </p><p>When searching for
a unit, if the specified string does not appear exactly as a unit
name, then the <code>units</code> program will try to remove a
trailing <span class="samp">s</span> or a trailing <span class="samp">es</span>.  If that fails, <code>units</code>
will check for a prefix. 
All of the standard metric prefixes are defined.

   </p><p>To find out what units and prefixes are available, read the standard
units data file.

<h2 class="chapter">7 Defining new units</h2>

<p><a name="index-defining-units-55"></a><a name="index-units_002c-redefinition-of-56"></a><a name="index-changing-units-definitions-57"></a>
All of the units and prefixes that <code>units</code> can convert are defined
in the units data file.  If you want to add your own units, you can
supply your own file.

   </p><p>A unit is specified on a single line by giving its name and an
equivalence.  Comments start with a <span class="samp">#</span> character, which can appear
anywhere in a line.  The backslash character (<span class="samp">\</span>)
acts as a continuation
character if it appears as the last character on a line, making it
possible to spread definitions out over several lines if desired. 
A file can be included by giving the command <span class="samp">!include</span> followed by
the file's name.  The file will be sought in the same directory as the
parent file unless a full path is given. 
<a name="index-include-files-58"></a>
Unit names must not contain any of the operator characters <span class="samp">+</span>,
<span class="samp">-</span>, <span class="samp">*</span>, <span class="samp">/</span>, <span class="samp">|</span>, <span class="samp">^</span> or the parentheses. 
They cannot begin with a digit or a decimal point (<span class="samp">.</span>), nor can
they end with a digit (except for zero). 
Be careful to define
new units in terms of old ones so that a reduction leads to the
primitive units, which are marked with <span class="samp">!</span> characters. 
Dimensionless units are indicated by using the string
<span class="samp">!dimensionless</span> for the unit definition. 
<a name="index-dimensionless-units-59"></a>
When adding new units, be sure to use the <span class="samp">-c</span> option to check that
the new units reduce properly. 
If you create a loop in the units definitions, then <code>units</code> will
hang when invoked with the <span class="samp">-c</span> options.  You will need to
use the <span class="samp">--check-verbose</span> option which prints out each unit as it
checks them.  The program will still hang, but the last unit printed
will be the unit which caused the infinite loop.

   </p><p>If you define any units which contain
<span class="samp">+</span> characters, carefully check them because the <span class="samp">-c</span> option
will not catch non-conformable sums.  Be careful with the <span class="samp">-</span>
operator as well.  When used as a binary operator, the <span class="samp">-</span>
character can perform addition or multiplication
depending on the options used to invoke <code>units</code>. 
To ensure consistent behavior use <span class="samp">-</span> only as a unary negation
operator when writing units definitions.  To multiply two units leave a
space or use the <span class="samp">*</span> operator.  To compute the difference
of <span class="samp">foo</span> and <span class="samp">bar</span> write <span class="samp">foo+(-bar)</span> or even <span class="samp">foo+-bar</span>.

   </p><p>Here is an example of a short units file that defines some basic
units:
<!-- noman -->

</p><pre class="example">     m       !               # The meter is a primitive unit

     rad     !dimensionless  # A dimensionless primitive unit

<h2 class="chapter">8 Defining nonlinear units</h2>

<p><a name="index-defining-nonlinear-units-60"></a><a name="index-nonlinear-units_002c-redefinition-of-61"></a><a name="index-changing-nonlinear-unit-definitions-62"></a><a name="index-nonlinear-unit-conversions-63"></a>Some units conversions of interest are nonlinear; for
example, temperature conversions between the Fahrenheit and Celsius
scales cannot be done by simply multiplying by conversions factors.

  </p><p>When you give a linear unit definition such as <span class="samp">inch 2.54 cm</span> you
are providing information that <code>units</code> uses to convert values in
inches into primitive units of meters.  For nonlinear units, you give
a functional definition that provides the same information.

  </p><p>Nonlinear units are represented using a functional notation. 
It is best to regard this notation not as a function call but
as a way of adding units to a number, much the same way that
writing a linear unit name after a number adds units to that number. 
Internally, nonlinear units are defined by a pair of functions
which convert to and from linear units in the data file, so that
an eventual conversion to primitive units is possible.

  </p><p>Here is an example nonlinear unit definition:

</p><pre class="example">     tempF(x) [1;K] (x+(-32)) degF + stdtemp ; (tempF+(-stdtemp))/degF + 32
</pre>
  <p class="noindent">A nonlinear unit definition comprises a unit name, a dummy parameter
name, two functions, and two corresponding units.  The functions tell
<code>units</code> how to convert to and from the new unit.  In order to
produce valid results, the arguments of these functions need to have
the correct dimensions.  To facilitate error checking, you may specify
the dimensions.

  </p><p>The definition begins with the unit name followed immediately (with no
spaces) by a <span class="samp">(</span> character.  In parentheses is the name of the
parameter.  Next is an optional specification of the units required by
the functions in this definition.  In the example above, the
<span class="samp">tempF</span> function requires an input argument conformable with
<span class="samp">1</span>.  For normal nonlinear units definitions the forward
function will always take a dimensionless argument. 
The inverse function requires an input argument conformable
with <span class="samp">K</span>.  In general the inverse function will need units
that match the quantity measured by your nonlinear unit. 
The sole purpose of the expression in brackets to enable
<code>units</code> to perform error checking on function arguments.

  </p><p>Next the function definitions appear.  In the example above, the
<span class="samp">tempF</span> function is defined by

</p><pre class="example">         tempF(x) = (x+(-32)) degF + stdtemp
</pre>
  <p class="noindent">This gives a rule for converting <span class="samp">x</span> in the units <span class="samp">tempF</span>
to linear units of absolute temperature, which makes it possible to
convert from tempF to other units.

  </p><p>In order to make conversions to Fahrenheit possible, you must give
a rule for the inverse conversions. The inverse will be <span class="samp">x(tempF)</span> and
its definition appears after a <span class="samp">;</span> character. 
In our example, the inverse is

</p><pre class="example">         x(tempF) = (tempF+(-stdtemp))/degF + 32
</pre>
  <p class="noindent">This inverse definition takes an absolute temperature as its argument
and converts it to the Fahrenheit temperature.  The inverse can be
omitted by leaving out the <span class="samp">;</span> character, but then conversions to
the unit will be impossible.  If the inverse is omitted then the
<span class="samp">--check</span> option will display a warning.  It is up to you to
calculate and enter the correct inverse function to obtain proper
conversions.  The <span class="samp">--check</span> option tests the inverse at one point
and print an error if it is not valid there, but this is not a guarantee
that your inverse is correct.

  </p><p>If you wish to make synonyms for nonlinear units, you still need to define
both the forward and inverse functions.  Inverse functions can be
obtained using the <span class="samp">~</span> operator.  So to create a synonym
for <span class="samp">tempF</span> you could write

</p><pre class="example">         fahrenheit(x) [1;K] tempF(x); ~tempF(fahrenheit)
</pre>
  <p><a name="index-units-functions-64"></a><a name="index-functions-of-units-65"></a>You may occasionally wish to define a function that operates on units. 
This can be done
using a nonlinear unit definition.  For example, the definition below
provides conversion between radius and the area of a circle.  Note
that this definition requires a length as input and produces an
area as output, as indicated by the specification in brackets.

</p><pre class="example">         circlearea(r) [m;m^2] pi r^2 ; sqrt(circlearea/pi)
</pre>
  <p><a name="index-linear-interpolation-66"></a><a name="index-units_002c-piecewise-linear-67"></a><a name="index-piecewise-linear-units-68"></a>Sometimes you may be interested in a piecewise linear unit such as
many wire gauges.  Piecewise linear units can be defined by specifying
conversions to linear units on a list of points. 
Conversion at other points will be done by linear interpolation. 
A partial definition of zinc gauge is

</p><pre class="example">         zincgauge[in] 1 0.002, 10 0.02, 15 0.04, 19 0.06, 23 0.1
</pre>
  <p class="noindent">In this example, <span class="samp">zincgauge</span> is the name of the piecewise linear
unit.  The definition of such a unit is indicated by the
embedded <span class="samp">[</span> character.  After the bracket, you should indicate the
units to be attached to the numbers in the table. 
No spaces can appear before the
<span class="samp">]</span> character, so a definition like <span class="samp">foo[kg meters]</span> is
illegal; instead write <span class="samp">foo[kg*meters]</span>.  The definition of the
unit consists of a list of pairs optionally separated by commas. 
This list defines a function for converting from the piecewise linear
unit to linear units.  The
first item in each pair is the function argument; the second item is the
value of the function at that argument (in the units specified in brackets). 
In this example,
we define <span class="samp">zincgauge</span> at five points.  For example, we set
<span class="samp">zincgauge(1)</span> equal to <span class="samp">0.002 in</span>.  Definitions like this
may be  more readable  if written using  continuation characters as
<!-- noman -->

</p><pre class="example">         zincgauge[in] \
             1 0.002  \
            10 0.02   \
            15 0.04   \
            19 0.06   \
            23 0.1
</pre>
  <!-- end noman -->
<!-- man .in +5m -->
<!-- man .ta 3m +3m -->
<!-- man .nf -->
<!-- man -->
<!-- man zincgauge[in]	 \\ -->
<!-- man 	1	0.002 \\ -->
<!-- man 	10	0.02 \\ -->
<!-- man 	15	0.04 \\ -->
<!-- man 	19	0.06 \\ -->
<!-- man 	23	0.1 -->
<!-- man .fi -->
<!-- man .in -2m -->
<p>With the preceeding definition, the following conversion can be
performed:

</p><pre class="example">         You have: zincgauge(10)
        You want: in
            * 0.02
            / 50
        You have: .01 inch
        You want: zincgauge
            5
</pre>
  <p>If you define a piecewise linear unit that is not strictly
monotonic, then the inverse will not be well defined.  If the inverse is
requested for such a unit, <code>units</code> will return the smallest
inverse.  The <span class="samp">--check</span> option will print a warning if a
non-monotonic piecewise linear unit is encountered.

<h2 class="chapter">9 Warranty/License</h2>

 
<p>The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.</p> 
 
<p>The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.</p> 
 
<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p> 
 
<p>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</p> 
 
<p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.</p> 
 
<p>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</p> 
 
<p>For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.</p> 
 
<p>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</p> 
 
<p>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</p> 
 
<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.</p> 
 
<h3><a name="terms"></a>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3> 
 
<h4><a name="section0"></a>0. Definitions.</h4> 
 
<p>&ldquo;This License&rdquo; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</p> 
 
<p>&ldquo;Copyright&rdquo; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.</p> 
 
<p>&ldquo;The Program&rdquo; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Licensees&rdquo; and
&ldquo;recipients&rdquo; may be individuals or organizations.</p> 
 
<p>To &ldquo;modify&rdquo; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &ldquo;modified version&rdquo; of the
earlier work or a work &ldquo;based on&rdquo; the earlier work.</p> 
 
<p>A &ldquo;covered work&rdquo; means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.</p> 
 
<p>To &ldquo;propagate&rdquo; a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.</p> 
 
<p>To &ldquo;convey&rdquo; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</p> 
 
<p>An interactive user interface displays &ldquo;Appropriate Legal Notices&rdquo;
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</p> 
 
<h4><a name="section1"></a>1. Source Code.</h4> 
 
<p>The &ldquo;source code&rdquo; for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  &ldquo;Object code&rdquo; means any non-source
form of a work.</p> 
 
<p>A &ldquo;Standard Interface&rdquo; means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.</p> 
 
<p>The &ldquo;System Libraries&rdquo; of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
&ldquo;Major Component&rdquo;, in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</p> 
 
<p>The &ldquo;Corresponding Source&rdquo; for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.</p> 
 
<p>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.</p> 
 
<p>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.</p> 
 
<h4><a name="section2"></a>2. Basic Permissions.</h4> 
 
<p>All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</p> 
 
<p>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</p> 
 
<p>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.</p> 
 
<h4><a name="section3"></a>3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</h4> 
 
<p>No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.</p> 
 
<p>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.</p> 
 
<h4><a name="section4"></a>4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</h4> 
 
<p>You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</p> 
 
<p>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</p> 
 
<h4><a name="section5"></a>5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</h4> 
 
<p>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.</li> 
 
<li>b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    &ldquo;keep intact all notices&rdquo;.</li> 
 
<li>c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.</li> 
 
<li>d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
&ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.</p> 
 
<h4><a name="section6"></a>6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.</h4> 
 
<p>You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.</li> 
 
<li>b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.</li> 
 
<li>c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.</li> 
 
<li>d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</li> 
 
<li>e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.</p> 
 
<p>A &ldquo;User Product&rdquo; is either (1) a &ldquo;consumer product&rdquo;, which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, &ldquo;normally used&rdquo; refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.</p> 
 
<p>&ldquo;Installation Information&rdquo; for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.</p> 
 
<p>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).</p> 
 
<p>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.</p> 
 
<p>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.</p> 
 
<h4><a name="section7"></a>7. Additional Terms.</h4> 
 
<p>&ldquo;Additional permissions&rdquo; are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.</p> 
 
<p>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.</p> 
 
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or</li> 
 
<li>b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or</li> 
 
<li>c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or</li> 
 
<li>d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or</li> 
 
<li>e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or</li> 
 
<li>f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &ldquo;further
restrictions&rdquo; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.</p> 
 
<p>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.</p> 
 
<p>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.</p> 
 
<h4><a name="section8"></a>8. Termination.</h4> 
 
<p>You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).</p> 
 
<p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.</p> 
 
<p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.</p> 
 
<p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.</p> 
 
<h4><a name="section9"></a>9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</h4> 
 
<p>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</p> 
 
<h4><a name="section10"></a>10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</h4> 
 
<p>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</p> 
 
<p>An &ldquo;entity transaction&rdquo; is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</p> 
 
<p>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.</p> 
 
<h4><a name="section11"></a>11. Patents.</h4> 
 
<p>A &ldquo;contributor&rdquo; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's &ldquo;contributor version&rdquo;.</p> 
 
<p>A contributor's &ldquo;essential patent claims&rdquo; are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, &ldquo;control&rdquo; includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.</p> 
 
<p>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.</p> 
 
<p>In the following three paragraphs, a &ldquo;patent license&rdquo; is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To &ldquo;grant&rdquo; such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.</p> 
 
<p>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  &ldquo;Knowingly relying&rdquo; means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.</p> 
  
<p>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.</p> 
 
<p>A patent license is &ldquo;discriminatory&rdquo; if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</p> 
 
<p>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.</p> 
 
<h4><a name="section12"></a>12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.</h4> 
 
<p>If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</p> 
 
<h4><a name="section13"></a>13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.</h4> 
 
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.</p> 
 
<h4><a name="section14"></a>14. Revised Versions of this License.</h4> 
 
<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.</p> 
 
<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.</p> 
 
<p>If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.</p> 
 
<p>Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.</p> 
 
<h4><a name="section15"></a>15. Disclaimer of Warranty.</h4> 
 
<p>THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p> 
 
<h4><a name="section16"></a>16. Limitation of Liability.</h4> 
 
<p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.</p> 
 
<h4><a name="section17"></a>17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.</h4> 
 
<p>If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.</p> 
 
<p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p> 
 
<h3><a name="howto"></a>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</h3> 
 
<p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</p> 
 
<p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the &ldquo;copyright&rdquo; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p> 
 
<pre>    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
 
    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.
 
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.
 
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.
</pre> 
 
<p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p> 
 
<p>If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:</p> 
 
<pre>    &lt;program&gt;  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
</pre> 
 
<p>The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an &ldquo;about box&rdquo;.</p> 
 
<p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a &ldquo;copyright disclaimer&rdquo; for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
&lt;<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/</a>&gt;.</p> 
 
<p>The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read

<a name="texinfo-footnotes-in-document"></a><h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> But Fahrenheit to
Celsius is linear, you insist.  Not so.  A transformation T is linear if
T(x+y)=T(x)+T(y) and this fails for T(x)=ax+b.  This transformation is
affine, but not linear. </p>
